# High Performance Web Pivot Table

This is my first .net project before I am using Golang. I will consider whether to re-implement this into Peak DataFrame or publish this .net project directly. https://youtu.be/yfJnYQBJ5ZY

# Features

➾  using C#, Vanilla JavaScript and W3.css for an integrated frontend to backend Web development, it does not implement any javascript framework or library

➾  real-time web technology use Fleck websocket

➾  the project does not have dependency other than .net 4.7.2, .net 5 or .net core 3.1, actually the web implementation has not yet using asp.net or asp.net core

➾  build-in a key-value NoSQL database for in-memory and disk versions

➾  building a set of algorithms to maximize parallel computing operating units which is extended to a big csv file and an in-memory table

➾  ultra-fast data import to web crosstab report with drag & drop and drill down capabilities

➾  interactive pivot table that lets you move X and Y columns with real-time drilldown by simple mouse actions

➾  crosstab report supports multi-level of analysis account trial balance by period/currency/region

➾  1.3+ second youFast can process a million rows of a csv file to produce a web summary report and 0.13+ second youFast can filter data from 10 million rows to produce a web crosstab report (testing machine: Dell OptiPlex 7070 Micro Form Factor with Intel Core i9-9900 8 Cores 32G Ram Windows 10)

➾  developing pagination in X and Y direction, different levels of numeric precision

➾  clicking an app file with only 500KB, user can enjoy zero installation and implementation

➾  the app can run on a share drive and USB memory stick

➾  this project is maintained up to 100% C# source code (i.e. no call for external dll except the open source "Fleck websocket")
