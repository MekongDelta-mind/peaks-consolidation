# WebNameSQL Go Version

Peaks Consoldiation is derived by a .net project WebNameSQL. You can see the full specification of "WebNameSQL.pdf" from the repository. Peaks framework will have an improvement version based on WebNameSQL. Any software can implement this framework to standardise ETL expression similar to HTML5, which benefits for end-users. The author have over 10 years of experience in designing ETL expression covers 4 different designs. WebNameSQL is the best design, so Peaks framework will adopt this design with some of improvement, particularly to adapt Python code.

WebNameSQL is a C# in-memory databending software that supports accountants using a web browser to interactive with accounting rules and tables for databending. However, this project became obsolete and it is replaced by a new project “Peaks DataFrame” to solve issues arising from real-time processing and big data. During a continuing effort in academic research, it is implemented new algorithms by using Golang which resulted in a performance gain of around 5X ~ 10X.

WebNameSQL-Go Version is a prototype that uses Golang to rewrite some of the functions using similar algorithms and data structures as WebNameSQL-Csharp Version. The author aims to prove that Golang is more suitable for the next programming language.

Commands to be re-implemented in the Peaks DataFrame will not be the same as WebNameSQL. Considering there are too many commands for your learning and practice, further consolidation and improvement is necessary. The use cases are no longer restricted to accounting; for example, some use cases will cover bioinformatics. Very high performance is essential for this project, so algorithms and data structure of Peaks will be a significant different from WebNameSQL.

Commands to be re-implemented in the Peaks Consolidation will not be the same as WebNameSQL. Considering there are too many commands for your learning and practice, further consolidation and improvement is necessary. Most importantly, Peaks will be extended to support Python. The use cases are no longer restricted to accounting; for example, some use cases will cover bioinformatics.  

A very high performance and reliability are essential for the development of Peaks, so algorithms and data structure of Peaks will be a significant different from WebNameSQL. The code design will be taking care of hardware resource utilisation.
