# WebNameSQL Go Version

WebNameSQL-Go Version is a prototype that uses Golang to rewrite some of the functions using similar algorithms and data structures as WebNameSQL-Csharp Version. The author aims to prove that Golang is more suitable for the next programming language.

Commands to be re-implemented in the Peaks DataFrame will not be the same as WebNameSQL. Considering there are too many commands for your learning and practice, further consolidation and improvement is necessary. Most importantly, Peaks will be extended to support Python. The use cases are no longer restricted to accounting; for example, some use cases will cover bioinformatics.  

A Very high performance is essential for the development of Peaks DataFrame, so algorithms and data structure of Peaks will be a significant different from WebNameSQL.

This readme is under construction. It will be updated some of instruction here to support you how to play this prototype.
